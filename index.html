        <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
        <p class="date">March 16, 2025</p>
        <p>I have started blogging 3 months ago! I have explored various fields before but I am passionate about frontend development. So I have shared my thoughts about frontend development. Firstly I thought that learning HTML and CSS will make me a frontend developer but later I have realized that there is a lot of stuff to do to become a frontend developer. Fast forward today I have built decent webpages like To-do list application, Quoto generator, Responsive desin etc usig HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Looking forward to explore many other things related to fronted journey!</p>
